      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <div class="separator"></div>
      <section><h2>Stack</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/vandesm14/stack">GitHub</a></p><p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://vandesm14.github.io/stack">Website/Docs</a></p><p><em>Stack is a dynamic, stack-based, concatenative programming language.</em></p><p>I like to call myself the idea man. I'll have a random idea, such as "How hard is it to make an OS?" or "What if there was a language that implemented the bare-bones and allowed you to build it up from there?". Can you guess which one stuck? Fast forward from mid-December of 2023, I, and my good friend <a href="https://codeberg.org/leonski">Leon</a>, started on the daunting task to create our own programming language.</p><p>Surprisingly, parsing and executing the code was easy. The part I found most challenging is sketching the behavior of the language. Because Stack is incredibly dynamic, the evaluation engine couldn't make almost any inferences about the code, which means I had to find creative ways to get features like scopes (took me many tries to perfect).</p><p>Another fun feature was building a debugger with Egui, which allowed us to see inside the language and keep track of every operation (and even go back in time!).</p><p>Stack isn't finished and neither am I. I'm still working hard to make it a fully-fledged and usable language.</p>
<h2>Node Shell</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/vandesm14/node-shell">GitHub</a></p><p><em>A CLI to bring scripts, binaries, and packager commands to your fingertips (inspired by nix-shell).</em></p><p>Inspired by the ease-of-use of <code>nix-shell</code>, I wanted to create a way to easily call commands and binaries in a NodeJS project. So, instead of running <code>pnpm dev</code>, you could run <code>dev</code>. Or instead of <code>pnpm prisma format</code>, you could just run <code>prisma format</code>. It was surprisingly simple to implement, though I did have to learn how to instantiate the BASH shell and give it a proper config.</p>
<h2>CC-Twigs</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/vandesm14/CC-Twigs">GitHub</a></p><p>A joint effort of a friend and I to build a collection of packages for <strong>ComputerCraft</strong> (a Minecraft mod). The packages are written completely in Lua, though the hosting server utilizes Deno (TypeScript). Our biggest challenge was and is building an in-game networking system to emulate IP and above.</p>
<h2>Conetto</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/vandesm14/conneto">GitHub</a></p><p>I have always been fascineted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station">number stations</a> and one day, I decided to build a Rust library based on it. Conetto provides a set of primitives that allow Text-To-Speech clips to be generated and spliced together in different ways.</p>
<h2>Jason</h2><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/vandesm14/jason">GitHub</a></p><p><strong>Website:</strong> https://jason.thedevbird.com</p><p>Jason is a dynamic JSON viewer that I built to tabulate and visualize JSON data. It is built with React and TypeScript, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>
<h2>Classaware</h2><p><strong>Website:</strong> http://classaware.org</p><p>A class countdown system I built for my High School. It is still operational and still recieves updates. Classaware was the first widespread project I had created in my coding career.</p>

      <h1>Replit Testimony</h1>
      <div class="separator"></div>
      <section><h2>How did I get here?</h2><p>My journey started on Replit, an online IDE, building tiny web apps, writing games and my own cryptography system. At the time, I <strong>barely knew anything</strong>.</p><p>However, as I learned the limits of my knowledge, I continued to push forward, learning more and more. Instead of taking a coding class at school or getting a certificate online, I spent my time <strong>absorbing everything</strong>.</p><p>As I progressed, my use of Replit was not only developing apps, but also interacting with the community. I climbed my way from being an <strong>early adopter</strong>, to a moderator of Repl Talk, the forum of the platform.</p><p>After graduating high school, I couldn’t find a job anywhere. But, after a Replit event in Discord, I saw that Amjad, the CEO, was still online. Knowing that this was my only chance to DM him (he was seldom online), I quickly wrote up a message on what I was good at and if I could get a job there.</p><p>That message marked the beginning of my <strong>professional career</strong>.</p><h2>Life at Replit?</h2><p>After a swift reply from Amjad, I was sent through a set of interviews. Then, one morning, I had received an email from HR that had sealed my career as a <strong>customer support engineer</strong>.</p><p>That was 3 years ago. Since then, I have learned so much from my fellow engineers and from the job itself. Starting out as a simple “Reply to these emails”, I found my way around a full-time job. As things quickly accelerated, I had to keep a <strong>fast-paced mindset</strong> in order to keep up.</p><p>I was involved in hiring the new manager and the other support engineers. Though my title stayed the same, I provided a valuable role in not only communicating with troubled users, but <strong>developing tools and software</strong> for our team.</p><p>Less than a year later, we had a new manager. With that, came more hires and changes to the team. We migrated from software to software, decreasing our footprint as much as we could. Through all of this, I was heavily involved in refactoring our integrations and workflows <strong>ensuring a smooth transition</strong>.</p><h2>Where am I now?</h2><p>I was laid off from Replit late February of 2024, along with a few other members of the support team. It wasn't due to performance or anything on my end.</p></section>
