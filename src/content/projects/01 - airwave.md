_Airwave is an ATC (Air Traffic Control) simulator based on real-world units and commands._

Frustrated by the current landscape of ATC games, I sought out to build one powered by AI. But wait, not just because AI is a buzzword, but because it allowed me to parse tasks from speech-to-text requests made by the user without a hard-coded syntax for the user to follow.
