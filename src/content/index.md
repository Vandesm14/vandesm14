# Hey!

I'm Shane, a friendly fullstack bird... I mean, _developer_. I specialize in creating side projects and causing errors.

## About

Like most developers, I started coding in **JavaScript** when I was 15 (2017). I opened up the browser's console, and noticed that I could "hack". I learned about HTML, and created my first form that did... nothing. It was a fake "Email Us" form that didn't to anything at all. However, that was the **first** project that I had created and had even created a name for it "PostIt!" (if I recall correctly). My naming skills have been strong since the beginning haha.

Nowadays, I am working as a full-time **Support Engineer for Replit**, working with customers, our documentation, and fixing issues in our website (powered by **NextJS + TS**). I also work on side projects, but in fear of duplication, I will kindly guide you to the [Projects](/#projects) section or my [GitHub](https://github.com/vandesm14).
