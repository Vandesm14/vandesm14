I am a developer (Rust & TypeScript), music artist, and multimedia enthusiast. I have been progremming in TypeScript for $xp years and switched to loving Rust about $rust years ago (it happens). Most of my projects start from what I call _"dumb ideas"_ that are usually ambitious in the beginning, but can end up working spectacularly.
