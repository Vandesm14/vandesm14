## How did I get here?

My journey started on Replit, an online IDE, building tiny web apps, writing games and my own cryptography system. At the time, I **barely knew anything**.

However, as I learned the limits of my knowledge, I continued to push forward, learning more and more. Instead of taking a coding class at school or getting a certificate online, I spent my time **absorbing everything**.

As I progressed, my use of Replit was not only developing apps, but also interacting with the community. I climbed my way from being an **early adopter**, to a moderator of Repl Talk, the forum of the platform.

After graduating high school, I couldn’t find a job anywhere. But, after a Replit event in Discord, I saw that Amjad, the CEO, was still online. Knowing that this was my only chance to DM him (he was seldom online), I quickly wrote up a message on what I was good at and if I could get a job there.

That message marked the beginning of my **professional career**.

## Life at Replit?

After a swift reply from Amjad, I was sent through a set of interviews. Then, one morning, I had received an email from HR that had sealed my career as a **customer support engineer**.

That was $job years ago. Since then, I have learned so much from my fellow engineers and from the job itself. Starting out as a simple “Reply to these emails”, I found my way around a full-time job. As things quickly accelerated, I had to keep a **fast-paced mindset** in order to keep up.

I was involved in hiring the new manager and the other support engineers. Though my title stayed the same, I provided a valuable role in not only communicating with troubled users, but **developing tools and software** for our team.

Less than a year later, we had a new manager. With that, came more hires and changes to the team. We migrated from software to software, decreasing our footprint as much as we could. Through all of this, I was heavily involved in refactoring our integrations and workflows **ensuring a smooth transition**.

## Where am I now?

I was laid off from Replit late February of 2024, along with a few other members of the support team. They assured me that it wasn't due to performance or anything on my end. Their stated reason was for "restructuring the support team". So, I've been enjoying my time off, working on Airwave, Stack, and other projects, along with applying to jobs once in a while. If you are reading this and you know a guy (or you are the guy), I'd love to hear from you!
